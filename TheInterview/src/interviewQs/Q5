Q5:
 
 String str1 = "abc";
 String str2 = new String("abc");
 String str3 = "abc";
 
 JVM has string pools which helps increase performance and decrease memory overhead since string allocation is very costly 
 in respect to both memory and time.Thus, in the code above, the str1 is created in JVM pooling string. On the other hand,
 str2 is created as a new String object, outside of the string pool,use heap. For str3, JVM checks the pool for the string if it 
 exists in the pool then it simply point the reference to this string, otherwise it creates new instance in the pool to 
 reduce memory overhead and  maximize the performance. As it can be seen creating string within the pool is more efficient.
