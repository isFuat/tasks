Q3:
 
 The i++'s value in the first loop is incremented and return the original value, and the 
 value of the ++i is incremented then return the incremented value. However, for below "for" loops
 it doesn't matter since value of i's aren't assigned to a new value, and both of them produce same results. 
 
 for (int i = 0; i <= 2; i++) {
	System.out.println(i);
 }
 
 for (int i = 0; i <= 2; ++i) {
	System.out.println(i);
 }
